Descrition:
 Coordinate your snakes with your friend and collect all the items at the same time.

 The two players can control the snake with WASD and arrow keys,
 and slow the snake down with Space and 'Numpad 0'.
 Also, if it is too hard, you can pause your snake with 'R' and 'Numpad 1'.

 There are six different colors based on the participants of the created blobs:
 Player01 - blue
 Player02 - red
 Player01 + Player02 - pink
 Player01 + Wall - dark blue
 Player02 + Wall - dark red
 Player01 + Player02 - purple

 All the item which you should collect has it's own color from the list above
 and turn white (activate) only if the proper blob (with the same color) is around it.

 You can check the number of the activated items at the top left corner and the record.
